        aspects: Memory representation. Data structures operations and its cost estimation. Introduction to linear data structures- Arrays, Linked List:
        Representation of linked list in memory, different implementation of linked list. Circular linked list, doubly linked list, etc. Application of
        linked list: polynomial manipulation using linked list, etc.


        2. Stacks and Queue: Stacks as ADT, Different implementation of stack, multiple stacks. Application of Stack: Conversion of infix to postfix 
        notation using stack, evaluation of postfix expression, Recursion. Queues: Queues as ADT, Different implementation of queue, Circular queue, 
        Concept of Dqueue and Priority Queue, Queue simulation, Application of queues.

        between different graph algorithms. Application of graphs.


        5. Sorting: Introduction, Sort methods like: Bubble Sort, Quick sort. Selection sort, Heap sort, Insertion sort, Shell sort, Merge sort and Radix 
        sort; comparison of various sorting techniques. Searching: Basic Search Techniques: Sequential search, Binary search, Comparison of search methods. 
        Hashing & Indexing. Case Study: Application of various data structures in operating system, DBMS etc.
