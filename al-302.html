          1. Basic ProbabilityProbability spaces, conditional probability, independence; Discrete random variables, Independent random variables, 
          the multinomial distribution, Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution, infinite sequences of Bernoulli trials, sums of independent 
          random variables; Expectation of Discrete Random Variables, Moments, Variance of a sum, Correlation coefficient, Chebyshev's Inequality.
          
          
          2. Continuous Probability DistributionsContinuous random varibales and their properties, distribution functions and densities, 
          normal, exponential and gamma densities.
          
          
          3. Bivariate DistributionsBivariate distributions and their properties, distribution of sums and quotients, conditional densities, Bayes' rule.
          
          
          4. Basic StatisticsMeasures of Central tendency: Moments, skewness and Kurtosis - Probability distributions: Binomial, Poisson and
          Normal - evaluation of statistical parameters for these three distributions, Correlation and regression - Rank correlation.
          
          
          5. Applied StatisticsCurve fitting by the method of least squares- fitting of straight lines, second degree parabolas and more 
          general curves. Test of significance: Large sample test for single proportion, difference of proportions, single mean, difference of
          means, and difference of standard deviations. 
          
          
          6. Small samplesTest for single mean, difference of means and correlation coefficients, test for ratio of variances - Chi-square test 
          for goodness of fit and independence of attributes.
